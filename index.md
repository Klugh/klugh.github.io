## Summary

Experienced software development and DevOps manager with 20+ years of experience delivering advanced software systems for small and large companies.  Strong leadership in the development of modern software solutions through clean, predictable, and testable code utilizing object-oriented design principles.  Full-stack Microsoft developer proficient in developing responsive user interfaces, web applications, web services, and relational database solutions.  Achieving rapid delivery with Azure Cloud Services through continuous integration with Git, automated builds, tests, deployments and scaling using Docker containers within fully managed Kubernetes clusters.

Experience includes managing 60+ software professionals over 3 years as a 1st and 2nd level manager and providing individual and team leadership to hundreds more.  Leadership experience includes coaching for the Intel® Software Academy and sharing expertise through conference presentations, coaching, training, and blogs as a member of the Intel® Agile Coaching Network.

Consistently receiving high marks for conducting technical training in object-oriented and component design principles, along with Agile, Lean, and XP practices, including test-driven development and continuous delivery.  Continuing to extend my track record of consistently improving individual and team delivery, along with improvements in quality, predictability, and productivity.  I pride myself in succeeding where others have failed.  My work has impacted some of the world's top brands including Intel, IBM, Bayer, Fiserv, Wells Fargo, Bank of New York, and GoDaddy.com to name a few.

My passion lies in improving team performance, software quality, and productivity through effective integration of software engineering, Agile, and DevOps practices.  I am a big proponent of optimizing software delivery by running applications and services on self-managed containers, which is clearly the biggest advancement in DevOps to date.

## Technical Training & Development Facilitation

The following is a list of courses I teach on a regular basis to uplift team capabilities:

**Enhancing Software Testability**<br>
Software testability is impacted by practices throughout the development lifecycle.  This class teaches engineering principles which greatly increase software testability, thereby raising code quality, test coverage, test effectiveness, and productivity, while reducing testing time, defects, and time to market.  Methods for enhancing testability of requirements, design, and software components are taught, along with practices to best utilize test doubles. 

**Principles & Practices of Test-Driven Development**<br>
This class teaches the principles and practices of Test-Driven Development (TDD) and demonstrates how proper software design evolves through application of the eXtreme Programming principle of Test First.  Unit testing principles are also covered, along with a thorough discussion on the benefits of TDD.  An application is developed (from start to finish) during this class to explain step-by-step and demonstrate first-hand how a high quality, testable design evolves by applying the three laws of Test-Driven Development. 

**Managing Technical Debt**<br>
Software is a huge asset for most companies, organizations, and governments.  The quality of that software contributes heavily to its value.  Effectively managing technical debt enables you to optimize the value of software and maximize time to market.  If you have to battle technical debt in an attempt to beat your competition to market with a new feature, you may lose any advantage by having to deal with complex or unreliable code that is not easily extendable.  To maintain business, market, or technological advantages, you must effectively manage technical debt incurred within all artifacts that define, implement, and validate your software.  This course examines what technical debt is, how it can benefit your organization and give you an advantage over your competition, how and when it should be (intentionally) incurred, and how and when it should be paid off.

**Understanding Test Doubles**<br>

**The Root of All Agile**<br>
This course focuses on the culture of Agile at Nationwide Insurance through presentation of the Agile experience, practice awareness, tea leaves, Gemba walks, and hands-on Agile exercises.  This is a required course for anyone starting new on a Nationwide Agile team or one that is looking to build a culture of excellence.

**Understanding the Value of Agile Principles**<br>
Agile principles are intended to help deliver greater product quality while increasing productivity. To achieve these benefits, project stakeholders must understand the value that come from putting each principle into practice. This class will reveal the value to be expected by applying each of the twelve Agile principles.

**Creating a Work Breakdown Structure for Agile Development**<br>Creating an effective representation of the development work is critical to maximizing productivity and increasing predictability.  This course provides several methods for determining the most effective Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) and demonstrates how to identify, decompose, and represent the work needed to deliver a high-quality product that fulfills customers’ needs.

**Writing Powerful User Stories**<br>This workshop provides hands-on lessons on how to write effective user stories, to understand why they are such an important artifact of Scrum, and how to realize their full value.

**Estimation Methods for Agile Development**<br>
This course examines both time-based and relative estimation methods, along with the benefits and disadvantages of each.

## Product Delivery

**Intel® Rapid Storage Technology (RST)**<br>
**Intel® Smart Response Technology (SRT)**<br>

**_Engineering Manager_**, v11.0 – v13.1<br>
Managed software configuration and release management activities to ensure the integrity of all software builds, product baselines, change management processes, version control, and IP plans for these multiple product lines.  Oversaw DevOps activities to fully automate the delivery pipeline for these lines.

Effectively managed a second team for all development of new and legacy software to support development operations in the CSG Software Center of Excellence.

As Security Champion, I led all efforts to ensure security requirements were being met throughout the entire development lifecycle for Intel® RST and Intel® SRT.
<br><br>
**_Technical Program Manager_**, v10.5 – v10.8<br>
Supported the delivery of product enhancements for both client and enterprise server solutions by leading a large Agile transformation for the entire CSG Software Center of Excellence.
